The purpose of these pages is to serve as a Portfolio for my recent coding work. I have created this portfolio as part of my 
CS499 Capstone course for Southern New Hampshire University. As part of this course, I have updated reviewed existing
code that I wrote for previous courses. These are in the form of Artifacts focusing on three major components of coding, 
however I have combined Artifact 1 and 2 into one project. Each code submission also comes with an accompanying document
to explain and justify its inclusion here. The final component is a code review video I created at the beginning of the course,
which summarized my plan to update code for artifacts 1 & 2.

Enjoy!
